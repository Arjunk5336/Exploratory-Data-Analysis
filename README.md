# Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly. The goal is to uncover insights into passenger demographics, ticket fares, and survival rates based on various features.

Features:

Loads and inspects the Titanic dataset

Displays summary statistics and data types

Visualizes distributions of numerical features

Examines correlations between numeric variables

Plots survival distributions across different categories

Visualizations Include

Age distribution histogram with KDE

Fare boxplot

Correlation heatmap (numeric features only)

Pairplot of Age, Fare, Pclass vs Survived

Count plots for:

Survival by Gender

Survival by Passenger Class

Interactive histogram (using Plotly) for Age vs Survived
